# Board-level model

The goal of this model is to simulate individual boards.
This is done primarily as a sort of an executable spec for the
kicad schematic designs, but also to simulate (either individual boards, or later full CPU).
This code is not intended to be synthesized.

Also the SystemVerilog module will likely be later used as a source for microcode ROMs.
