# CPU Mechanical & Electrical Construction

- Eurocard (3U, 100x160mm)
- 96 pin connector
- Backplane split into two zones
  - Core zone:
    - CPU internal cards (register decoder, register slices, ALU, instruction decoder, ...).
    - Each backplane slot has potentially different pinout
    - 3D printed keys enforcing correct card placement?
  - Memory / peripherial zone
    - All pinouts identical
- "Tiled" backplane?
  - Individual pieces of backplane connected together using edge connectors
  - To simplify development, make cheaper fails
- Clock
  - Selectable speed main clock (>=10MHz max speed)
    - 20MHz oscillator piped into 74HC193
    - DIP switch controling the frequency
    - Second counter chip for clock assymetry?
  - Single step mode (buttons: Stop, Step, Run)
  - Break function
    - If enabled by a HW switch, goes into single step mode.
    - Interrupt if break signal arrives and break is disabled
  - Sleep mode (clock is ignored until an interrupt arrives)
